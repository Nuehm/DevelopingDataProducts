# DevelopingDataProductsAssignment1
Repo for the first peer review assignment of the Coursera course "Developing Data Products" (Week 2)

Dear Mates,

I have some troubles with the gh-pages setup for github (I am always getting a 404 error). 

So I would like to ask you to download "CapitalsOfTheWorld.html" and to open it from your PC.

Hopefully I will learn how to do it properly soon.

Thanks and best regards,
Hendrik
